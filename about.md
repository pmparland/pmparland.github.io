**Patrick McParland** Senior Project Manager
<p class="message">
  20 years of management experience combined with hands on technical experience

</p>

* Traditional project management expertise and experience with PMP certification

* Agile expertise and experience with certification as a Scrum Master

* Experience in programming languages from C, C++ thru to Java with Spring



Programme and project management is more than just processes, procedures and checklists. To add value you need to be able to understand the details of what is being produced either as a business analysts or as software developer. My background and preference is for managers to get to know the system being developed as a developer.

Most recently I have been developing in Java with Spring Boot to create REST services.

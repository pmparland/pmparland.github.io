Working with a small telecoms company who provide billing APIs so that mobile apps can access the billing systems of some large telecom operators. After reviewing their current documentation I decided that there must be a standardized form and as usual there was. [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) has been available for several years and is excellent. 

However, Swagger is also a good example of the strengths and weaknesses of open source projects. Great technology, superb code, working examples but integrating all of this into a working system takes effort and a lot of hunting on-line to find good tutorials. I am being harsh but it took me a while to work out how best to combine the different tools developed by the Swagger community: SwaggerUI, Swagger Editor and SDK Generators. These are the main ones but there are also auxiliary tools available. 

Swagger is built on the Swagger Specification which uses [YAML](http://yaml.org/) to specify your API. The Swagger Editor is a great tool to write and interactively test your specification. The completed YAML can then be translated into JSON for use with the SwaggerUI tool which will generate a standalone web site which you can share with your API users. For me these tutorials where a godsend:

The good news is that now we have some good documentation to share with our partners.
